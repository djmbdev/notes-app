flutter pub get
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

You must connect this app to your own Firebase project.

2. Add your Android and/or iOS app to the Firebase project
3. Download the configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
4. Place the files in the following directories:
   - `android/app/` # for Android
   - `ios/Runner/` # for iOS (use Xcode to add the file)
5. Enable Cloud Firestore:
   - Go to Firestore Database in the Firebase Console
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for development only)
   - Select a region and click "Enable"

Update your Firebase initialization code using your own values:

```dart
await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: const FirebaseOptions(
    apiKey: "yourApiKey",
    appId: "yourAppId",
    messagingSenderId: "yourMessagingSenderId",
    projectId: "yourProjectId",
  ),
);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: Do not commit your real Firebase API keys to public repositories.

üîí **Production Note**: Test mode allows public access ‚Äî secure your app with proper Firestore Security Rules for production.
